# TCG Price Tracker

## Description:

This is a Pokemon Trading Card Game card-search application that allows the user to save their favorite cards and keep track of their prices.

What makes this application unique is the easily readable card arts and information along with the ability to convert the prices of the cards into various crypto currencies.

Different search criteria are included in the sidebar to narrow down searches if you want to get very specific.

When you click on a card, you will be lead to a page for that individual card with more information and a link to buy the card. These pages are made using query parameters so you can share links with friends.
